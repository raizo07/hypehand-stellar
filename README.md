HypeHand - A Stellar Blockchain Project for Gifting.

HypeHand is the Star Gifting platform; crypto gifting app built on the Stellar blockchain. It enables admins to manage superstars, creators, and users through a secure, scalable admin dashboard. Inspired by Whisper's on-chain messaging and XP systems, StarGift allows seamless token gifting, secret rooms for exclusive interactions, and progression tracking, all powered by Stellar's fast, low-cost transactions. This repository contains the NestJS-based API, including authentication, blockchain integrations, and resource management for the admin interface. 

Features:

Admin Authentication & RBAC: Secure JWT-based login with role-based access control (superadmin, moderator). User & Creator Management: Full CRUD for users, profiles, and verification (KYC integration). Stellar Blockchain Integration: Wallet creation, token minting/burning, transaction history, and gifting mechanics. Gamification: XP system, leaderboards, and referral rewards. Messaging & Rooms: On-chain message management and private secret rooms. Moderation Tools: Content flagging, reporting, bans, and audit logs. Analytics & Notifications: Real-time metrics, push/email/SMS notifications. Performance & Security: Rate limiting, caching (Redis), queuing (Bull), and comprehensive testing. Scalability: GraphQL support, API versioning, and scheduled tasks. Compliance: GDPR data privacy, backups, and exports.

🛠 Tech Stack

Backend: NestJS (TypeScript), TypeORM (PostgreSQL) Blockchain: Stellar SDK for asset issuance, payments, and on-chain data. Auth: JWT, Passport, bcrypt Queue & Cache: Bull (Redis) Testing: Jest (unit, integration, E2E) Deployment: Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD Monitoring: Winston logging, Prometheus Docs: Swagger/OpenAPI Other: @nestjs/swagger, i18n, Sharp (image processing)

Quick Start Prerequisites

Node.js (v18+) PostgreSQL (v14+) Redis (v7+) Docker (optional, for easy setup) Stellar testnet account (for development)

Installation

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hypehand.git cd hypehand

Install dependencies: npm install

Set up environment variables:Copy .env.example to .env and fill in your values: DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/hypehand REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379 JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key STELLAR_SECRET_KEY=your-stellar-secret-key NODE_ENV=development PORT=3000

Run database migrations: npm run migration:run

Start the development server: npm run start:dev

The API will be available at http://localhost:3000. Access Swagger docs at http://localhost:3000/api. Docker Setup (Optional) For a containerized setup: docker-compose up -d

This spins up PostgreSQL, Redis, and the NestJS app. 📖 API Documentation

Swagger UI: Visit /api after starting the server for interactive docs. Endpoints Overview: /auth/login: Admin authentication. /users: Manage users (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE). /creators: Creator profiles. /tokens: Gift token operations (mint/burn). /transactions: Stellar transaction history. /analytics: Dashboard metrics.

GraphQL: Available at /graphql for flexible queries.

Example cURL for login: curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-d '{"username":"admin","password":"password"}'

🔧 Usage Admin Workflow

Login: Use /auth/login to get a JWT token. Manage Users: List users with /users?limit=10&page=1, create via POST. Blockchain Ops: Mint tokens with /tokens/mint (requires Stellar integration). Moderation: Flag content via /moderation/flag, ban users at /bans. Analytics: Fetch metrics at /analytics/dashboard.

Stellar Integration

All gifting uses Stellar assets for tokens. Test on Stellar's Futurenet (testnet equivalent as of 2025). Ensure your Stellar secret key is secure in env vars.

🧪 Testing Run tests: npm run test # Unit + Integration npm run test:e2e # End-to-End
